## Introduction

This Chrome addon was created to automate some of the steps needed for investigating a task. On the account page, it automatically builds a table and populates it with data related to the account (taken from another page). This eliminates a lot of repetitive actions that are performed on a daily basis. 
- The original process required a user to: 
  - 1. Click the case > 2. Click the account > 3. Scroll down to relevant cases section > 4. Click view all cases > 5. Click sort > 6. Investigate > 7. Go back to account > 8. Start working
- This addon reduces the actions to the following: 
  - 1. Click the case > 2. Hover the account > 3. Investigate > 4. Start work

The addon only works on Google Chrome.
